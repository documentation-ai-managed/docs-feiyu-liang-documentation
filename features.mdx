Organize your documentation into a clear hierarchy. Create folders to group related pages, set custom navigation menus, and use frontmatter for metadata.

    In the sidebar, click the new folder icon and name it `api-reference`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Pages" icon="file-plus">
    Right-click a folder and select "New Page". Use YAML frontmatter like this:
    
    ````markdown
    ```yaml
    ---
    title: API Endpoints
    description: All available API routes
    ---
    ```
    ````
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize Navigation" icon="menu">
    Drag pages in the outline editor to reorder. Enable auto-generated sidebars for nested structures.
